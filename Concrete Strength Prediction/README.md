# Concrete Strength Prediction

The Concrete Strength Dataset is dataset that will be used to analyze and predict the strength of thw concrete based on many factors. The model will do comprehensive analysis and predict the compressive strength of concrete using various machine learning models. The process involves data preprocessing, exploration, and building predictive models. 

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations on data.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization through histograms, pairplots, scatter plots, and boxplots.
- **Seaborn:** Enhances the visual appeal of plots and statistical graphics.
- **scikit-learn:** Provides machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and data preprocessing functionalities.

## Data Preprocessing and Exploration

### 1. Data Loading and Overview

- The concrete dataset is loaded using Pandas.
- Basic information about the dataset, including total rows and columns, is displayed.
- Missing values in the dataset are checked and printed.

### 2. Visualizing Data Distributions

- Data distributions are visualized through histograms for numerical columns and pairplots for relationships between different features.
- Outliers are identified using boxplots.

### 3. Exploring Relationships

- Relationships between variables are explored using scatter plots and a correlation matrix heatmap.

## Data Preparation for Modeling

### 1. Identifying and Handling Categorical Columns

- Categorical columns in the dataset are identified.

### 2. Splitting the Dataset

- The dataset is split into independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (compressive strength).
- Further, the data is divided into training and testing sets.

### 3. Standardizing Feature Data

- StandardScaler is used to standardize the feature data for better model performance.

## Linear Regression Model

### 1. Building and Evaluating the Model

- A Linear Regression model is trained on the standardized data.
- The model's performance is evaluated using R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Predicted vs. actual values are visualized through a scatter plot.

## Ridge and Lasso Regression Models

### 1. Building and Evaluating the Models

- Ridge and Lasso Regression models are trained with hyperparameter tuning.
- Model performance is assessed, and scores along with errors are reported.
- Predicted vs. actual values are visualized through scatter plots.

## Random Forest Regression Model

### 1. Building and Evaluating the Model

- A Random Forest Regression model is implemented.
- The model's performance is evaluated using R-squared, MSE, and RMSE.
- Predicted vs. actual values are visualized through a scatter plot.

## Decision Tree Regression Model

- Implemented a Decision Tree Regressor model.
- Assessed the model's performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), MSE, and R² Score.
- Visualized predicted vs. actual values.
    - Results:
    - MAE: 4.293786407766991
    - MSE: 42.58102330097088
    - R² Score: 0.8347503240203619
- Decision Tree Regression showed acceptable performance but not as good as other models.

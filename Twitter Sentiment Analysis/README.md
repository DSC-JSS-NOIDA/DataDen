# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project is aimed at performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data, classifying tweets into three main categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the creation and evaluation of machine learning models.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: In this phase, we clean and prepare the Twitter data for analysis. This includes removing null values, cleaning URLs, punctuation, numbers, and stopwords from the tweets, and standardizing sentiment labels.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We explore the dataset by visualizing the distribution of sentiment categories, entity categories, and the most frequent words in the tweets. EDA helps in understanding the data and gaining insights.

3. **Model Building**: We create and train machine learning models using different algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to classify tweets into sentiment categories. Each model is evaluated to assess its performance.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: We use evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports to assess the performance of the models. These metrics provide insights into how well the models are classifying tweets.

## Running the Project

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the project files, including the dataset and Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in your Jupyter environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to preprocess the data, perform EDA, build and evaluate machine learning models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of Twitter sentiment data, from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to building and evaluating machine learning models. The results and insights gained from this analysis can be used for sentiment classification in various Twitter-related applications.
